# Landmark-Agnostic-FIQA
DTU master thesis

This project is from the master thesis "Landmark-agnostic Face Image Quality Assessment". The primary focus of the research is a comparative analysis between the landmark-agnostic approach, represented by the face-parsing method, and the landmark-dependent approach, represented by the Dlib method. The evaluation involves measuring various quality components, such as head length, head size, inter-eye distance, eye open, mouth closed, and crop of the face image. In addition, a novel heuristic function for computing head length is proposed and tested under various resolutions. The results of the comparative analysis, heuristic function testing, and their addressing of the research questions are presented through illustrative diagrams. The thesis concludes with suggestions for addressing limitations and outlines potential future work.

**Required libraries:**

To run the face-parsing scripts, please install Face-parsing.PyTorch (https://github.com/zllrunning/face-parsing.PyTorch.git).
